	<h1>MV and THz Dielectric Properties of Single Crystal Along One Single Direction</h1>
    
    <p>
		New generation wireless communication systems require characterisations of dielectric permittivity and loss tangent at microwave and terahertz bands. 
		La2Ti2O7 is a candidate material for microwave application. However, all the reported microwave dielectric data are average value from different directions of a single crystal, which could not reflect its anisotropic nature due to the layered crystal structure. 
		Its dielectric properties at the mi- crowave and terahertz bands in a single crystallographic direction have rarely been reported. In this work, a single crystal ferroelectric La2Ti2O7 was prepared by floating zone method and its dielectric properties were characterized from 1 kHz to 1 THz along one single direction. 
		The decrease in dielectric permittivity with increasing frequency is related to dielectric relaxation from radio frequency to microwave then to terahertz band. The capability of characterizing anisotropic dielectric properties of a single crystal in this work opens the feasibility for its microwave and terahertz applications
	</p>

    <h2> Why we need this material? </h2>
	<p>
		Development in wireless communication and sensing is pushing the operating frequencies of dielectric devices - relevant to filters, antennas, resonators and phase shifters - from radio frequency (RF) to the micro- wave (MW) band and the terahertz (THz) band. Preferred dielectric properties at frequencies above RF are reasonably high dielectric permittivity, high quality factor (low loss) and low tempera- ture coefficient. As dielectric permittivity and loss of a material is frequency dependent, it is necessary to characterize dielectric properties at MW and THz bands for development of high frequency applications.
	</p>
	<p>
		The perovskite layer structured materials A2B2O7, which is charac- terized by corner sharing BO6 octahedra slabs bonded by the interlayer A-site cations, are good MW ceramics due to their excellent dielectric properties, i.e. high temperature stability and low dielectric loss. La2Ti2O7 single crystal is a ferroelectric material belonging to the A2B2O7 family. There are many reports related to the progress on La2Ti2O7 material. 
		However, most of the research are focused on studying its piezoelectric properties and dielectric properties at low frequencies. 
		There is limited information on characterization of dielec- tric properties of La2Ti2O7 single crystal at microwave and terahertz frequencies. 
		At radio frequency, both poled single crystal and unpoled textured polycrystal ceramics of La2Ti2O7 show anisotropic dielectric properties, which are consistent with the layered crystal structure of La2Ti2O7. 
		However, the reported MW dielectric properties in literature were average values along different di- rections of a single crystal, which could not reflect its anisotropic nature due to the layered crystal structure. Moreover, its properties at the THz frequency region have rarely been reported. In this study, dielectric properties of single crystal LTO were characterized along one specific single direction at the MW and THz bands.

	<h2> How to make this material </h2>
	<p>
		Polycrystalline La2Ti2O7 ceramic feed rod was prepared in advance using conventional solid-state reaction method. 
		La2O3 and TiO2 powders were heated at 800 ◦C overnight to remove absorbed moisture. 
		The raw materials were weighed in stoichiometric ratio and ground manually with an agate mortar and pestle for half an hour before being pressed into pellets and calcined in air at 1250 ◦C for 10 h. 
		The pellets were then re-ground and sintered at 1350 ◦C for 10 h and 1450 ◦C for 2 h with intermediate grinding. 
		The obtained La2Ti2O7 powders were pressed into green feed rod at 80 MPa. 
		Then the green rod was sintered at 1580 ◦C for 10 h. Single crystal La2Ti2O7 was grown by floating zone tech- nique using an image furnace. The growth gas environment is 1 bar air pressure with a float rate of 0.5 L/min. 
		Polycrystalline feed rod and single crystal seed rod were counter-rotated at 10 and 30 rpm, respec- tively. The growth speed used was 2 mm/h.

	<h2> How to characterize this material?</h2>
	<p>
		Dielectric data at MW frequency were characterized using a micro- wave noninvasive planar sensor based on the complementary split ring resonator (CSRR). 
		Picture below shows the numerical models of the CSRR system and the real measurement kit. 
		The circular cross-sections of CSRRS are chosen to trap the signal propagation from the planar micro-strip line which is embedded in the ground plane, and create the electric field resonance at a certain frequency.

	<p>
		The dielectric properties of single crystal LTO-a at the THz frequencies were measured using a THz time-domain spectroscopy (THz- TDS) system. 
		Its dielectric properties were measured in trans- mission mode to obtain the time domain spectrum. Using the Fourier transformation function, the corresponding amplitude and phase spectra versus frequency were determined from 0.2 THz to 1 THz. 
		After that, the dielectric parameters including permittivity and loss tangent in the THz region were calculated according to the information of amplitude, phase, reference spectrum and the sample’s spectra
	</p>

	<h2>What is the structure of La2Ti2O7 ?</h2>
	<p>
		The obtained La2Ti2O7 single crystal rod was transparent and rufous colored, 7 mm in diameter and 12 cm in length. 
		XRD patterns of both the single crystal and feed rod polycrystalline La2Ti2O7 shown in Fig. b. 
		The La2Ti2O7 feed rod is pure without any detectable secondary phases and the diffraction peaks of the feed rod are in good agreement with the data reported by S.Nanamatsu. 
		Spontaneous polarization of La2Ti2O7 is developed along b axis. 
		As the sample was cut parallel to the cleavage plane (Fig. b), it only shows diffraction peaks from (h00) plane. 
		Crystal structure of the La2Ti2O7 material along c and b axis projection are shown in Fig. c and d.

	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>
		Relative dielectric permittivity (ε′) and loss tangent (tan δ) of the single crystal LTO-a at kHz frequency are shown in Fig. 
		Generally, the overall dielectric response consists of four parts, namely electronic polarization, ionic polarization, dipolar polarization and space charge polarization. 
		These individual polarization mechanisms have different relaxation time, thus will cause changes in dielectric properties with frequency. 
		As is shown in Fig, the dielectric permittivity and loss in the investigated frequency range are nearly frequency independent, which means that the effect of space charge is weak and the relaxation frequency of the active polarization mechanisms are above kHz frequency. 
		In this case, the electronic polarization, ionic polarization and dipolar polarization contribute to dielectric property of single crystal La2Ti2O7 at kHz frequency. The measured relative permittivity ε′ and loss tan δ values of unpoled single crystal along a-direction are 46.1 and 0.003.

		Picture(a) below shows good consistency in resonance frequency of 4.89 GHz for the measurement of pure CSRR model. After loading the sample, the resonance frequency is shifted to 2.77 GHz, as is shown in picture(b). 
		By tuning the data in the CST software, a linear function of can be obtained, where x is the inverse of the square of the center fre- quency and y is dielectric permittivity. Put the measured resonance frequency 2.77 into the equation, and the calculated dielectric permit- tivity at 4.89 GHz is 29.82. The loss tangent was calculated with the same CST model using the permittivity data and the loss tangent at this frequency is 0.006. The decrease in the dielectric permittivity at the MW frequency compared with that at kHz frequencies is possibly related to the relaxation of domain walls

	<p>
		Single crystalline La2Ti2O7 has been prepared by floating zone technique and its dielectric properties along one single crystallographic direction are characterized at MW and THz bands. The decrease in dielectric permittivity at the MW and THz band compared with the values at kHz frequency is related to dielectric relaxation, which is possibly related to the relaxation of ferroelectric domain walls. At the THz band, the increase of the dielectric permittivity with frequency increasing can be attributed to harmonic lattice vibrations. This work provides a promising method to characterize high frequency dielectric properties along one specific direction of a single crystal which shows anisotropic structure.
