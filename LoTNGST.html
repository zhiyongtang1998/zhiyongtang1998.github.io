	<h1>IoT for Next-Generation Shuttlecock Sports Training</h1>
    
    <p>
		At present, there are very few researches on shuttlecock movements based on wearable devices of the Internet of Things. Most of them are movement analysis and research carried out by visual observation and video playback. This method is only suitable for analysis after competitions. Its limitations are It can't reach the accuracy of subtle movements, nor can it be used for the team's daily training. In the research of this project, we propose a motion recognition and assessment system based on Wearable Sensing Devices(WSD). The main contributions of this project include the following aspects:
		1) using WSD to collect motion data and assess the skill level of the shuttlecock motion through the six-dimensional motion data generated by the WSD.
		2) Using machine learning algorithms and theories of signal characteristics, a shuttlecock motion recognition method based on signal data analysis and machine learning algorithms is proposed.
		3) Through the comparison of experimental results, the performance differences of different machine learning algorithms in the recognition and assessment of shuttlecock motions are analyzed.
	</p>

    <h2> How does the system work? </h2>
	<p>
		Here we detail the complete technical solution developed to build a smart shuttlecock action recognition and assessment system based on low-power Bluetooth communication and Cloud technology. 
		It contains hardware and software parts as well as sensor placement locations. 
		The general system setup principles are shown in picture below. 
	</p>

	<center><img src="images/System-all.png" alt="KGSum Example" height="400" align="middle"/></center>


	<p>
		The system consists of a sensor node, a high- speed camera, a mobile device, a cloud server, and a laptop. 
		We used this system to collect motion data from badminton players and to recognize different badminton actions. 
		The general work principle for the system is that data collected by an WSD was sent to a mobile device through BLE. 
		Once the mobile phone received the data, it sent the motion raw data to the remote server via Cloud technology. 
		After collecting all data, users could then view shuttlecock players’ analyzed data with client devices.
	</p>

	<h2>How does the algorithm work </h2>
	<p>
		After data collection, a typical machine learning data processing method was implemented in our shuttlecock actions recognition and skill level assessment system.
		This framework includes preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and classification. Each stage of this framework can be implemented using a variety of methods. 
		To demonstrate performance in this section, we utilized the support vector machine (SVM) classifier.

				We used PCA to preprocess the data before classification because PCA shows better performance compared to nonlinear dimensionality reduction.

	<h2> Conclusion </h2>
	<p>The performance levels represented by the skill data were thus estimated by SVM, kNN, LR, and RF classifiers. Comparisons of these classifiers show SVM achieves high accuracy in serve actions and kick actions recognition and in assessing levels of players in executing different shuttlecock action. Therefore, we envision that the IoT framework presented in this project will play an important role in sports analysis where ancle actions are important.
